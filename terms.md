##### A. Filename (Required)
The filename of the object (ex. `arce_lrwp_0001.tiff`) is recorded in the "**Filename**" field. For file naming best practices, see the the "[File Naming & Organization Guide](https://uclalibrary.github.io/ideptoolkit/filenaming.html)."

##### B. Local ID (Recommended)

Do not include initial definite or indefinite articles in the title (The, A, An). Use standard title capitalization of the language used.

There are three types of titles:

#### A. Title (Original Language)
