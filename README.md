## IDEP Partner Toolkit
This repo hosts the pages for UCLA's IDEP Parter Toolkit, a guide to standards and workflows for IDEP partner institutions. IDEP (International Digital Ephemera Project) is an initiative to digitize, preserve and provide broad public access to print, images, multimedia, and social networking resources produced worldwide.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll and the Hydejack theme (https://qwtel.com/hydejack/).
