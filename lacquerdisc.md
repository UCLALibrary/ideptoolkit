### Assessment of discs
1. Review and inspect discs. Wear cotton gloves when handling. Fingerprints can leave permanent imprints on lacquer discs.

2. Handle discs by the edges only, with hands evenly spaced at about 3 and 9 o’clock positions.

3. Look for any surface damage. Discs showing widespread signs of cracking, crazing or delamination will not be cleaned, as moisture and physical contact can accelerate the failure. Any discs with minimal edge wear may be cleaned, though special attention must be paid during cleaning to avoid oversaturating the edges. Any discs with small, localized areas of loss can be cleaned with extreme care, carefully avoiding the area of loss.

4. For this stage we will focus on 3 groups of discs:
  * Discs in good condition with minimal particulate contamination, no mold, no areas of delamination or cracking. Minimal edge loss is okay.
  * Discs with surface contamination such as paper stuck to the disc or mold.
  * Discs with exuded plasticizer. These are palmitic and stearic acid deposits on the surface that have a white greasy, crystalline or powdery appearance.

  *This will give us an opportunity to set up equipment, provide training and establish handling and technical expertise.*

5. Discs with delamination and extreme cracking will be grouped together and prioritized on a future visit. They will require a separate workflow that requires a binocular microscope, a specialized tonearm and careful handling.

### Cleaning
1. Clean and rinse discs by hand using appropriate brushes and a disc cleaning solution called Disc Doctor Miracle Record Cleaner.  This cleaner is widely used by archives and is relatively mild compared to other solutions that require special equipment for preparation.

2. Discs in good condition or with surface contamination such as dust, paper particles or mold will be cleaned with the **regular strength** solution.

3. Discs with palmitic and stearic acid deposits will be cleaned with the **augmented strength** solution. This version has a higher concentration of surfactants. The cleaner may be left on for up to **2 minutes** before rinsing. Discs with exuded plasticizer may need repeated cleanings to clean. In cases of stubborn or heavy surface deposits, ammonia may be added in very small amounts—2-4 drops only.

4. Both the regular strength and augmented strength solutions are typically mixed in a designated small application bottle at a ratio of:
> **2 parts cleaner to 1 part distilled water**

5. To prevent any confusion between the two solution strengths, the bottles for the augmented solution are clearly marked with **red** dots.

6. Discs will be cleaned on a clean, smooth surface to avoid scratching. Soft silicon protector mats are provided, but a plastic tablecloth can also be used.

7. If a disc has excessive loose dirt and debris and gently brush in a direction perpendicular to the grooves with a 2-4” wide tapered bristle paintbrush.

8. APPLYING CLEANER: Place the disc flat on the work surface. Apply cleaner to the wet cleaning brush (distinguished by the black cleaning pads) so that the fiber surface is almost fully saturated with fluid. For a standard 12” LP-sized brush, 2-3 ml is recommended by the manufacturer for the initial wetting and approx. half as much for subsequent sides. More will be needed for a 16” disc.

  Lightly run the saturated brush completely around the disc to wet the entire surface. Avoid wetting the record label. Then clean 1/3 of the grooved surface at a time with three back and forth sweeps. Apply enough pressure on the brush to ensure good contact without crushing the pad into the grooves. The movement of the fluid is cleaning the groove walls. The brush is simply helping the fluid to move around. There should be enough fluid in the brush to provide a small puddle in front of the moving brush. Move this puddle around as cleaning progresses.

  When cleaning is complete, remove most of the fluid by sweeping it up into the cleaning brush as you lightly drag it around the disc surface. Remove residual fluid from the disc with a cotton cloth. Remove residual cleaner from the brush by gently squeezing the upper pile of the cleaning pad with the plastic handle of a clean toothbrush or a plastic scraper. **Never dry the record completely by scrubbing with cloth or paper as this introduces static.**

9. RINSING: Saturate a second wet brush with distilled water from a clean container. Spread water around the disc to remove the excess cleaner using the same technique as in the cleaner application step. Avoid wetting the label. Remove residual rinse water from the grooves with a cotton square. Use the slightly dampened cloth to gently wipe label. Always remove any excess water from labels by patting, not wiping.

  *Keep brushes and drying clothes used for cleaner and water separate. 3 separate sets should be used for regular strength cleaner, augmented cleaner and water. You may want to label the brushes to avoid confusion.*

10. DRYING: After cleaning and rinsing the reverse side, allow the record to thoroughly air dry (3-6 min), depending on humidity and airflow before digitizing or storing. Used a plastic drying dish rack or something similar.

11. POST CLEANING & REGULAR MAINTENANCE: Once dry, apply a Disc Doctor Dry Brush (distinguished by the red cleaning pads) to remove excess lint or dust. Store in a fresh sleeve if available. All recordings should be dry brushed before and after regular use.
